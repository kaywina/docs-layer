## Introduction

Every piece of software we use come with vulnerabilities, whether it’s an operating system, a browser, or a SaaS platform. Security teams rely on a global system of **CVE identifiers** (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) to keep track of these flaws. A CVE entry provides a unique ID and key details about each vulnerability, making it easier to coordinate fixes and communicate risks.

In this tutorial, we’ll take a closer look at CVE data through a public API provided by [CIRCL](https://cve.circl.lu/). What makes this API especially useful is that it ships with an **OpenAPI specification**—a machine-readable description of its endpoints, parameters, and responses.

As a technical writer, I’ll show you how to use that spec to:
- **Explore the API in Postman**, where we can run real queries against CVE records.
- **Generate professional documentation with Redoc**, turning the raw spec into clean, readable docs for your team.

By the end, you’ll see not just how to pull live vulnerability data, but also how modern API specs streamline both **security workflows** and **documentation practices**.

## Getting the OpenAPI Spec

Before we can explore the API or generate documentation, we need its **OpenAPI specification file**. This file acts like a blueprint: it describes all the available endpoints, their inputs and outputs, and even example payloads.

For this tutorial, we’ll use the **Vulnerability-Lookup API** maintained by **CIRCL**. You can get the OpenAPI file via this [APIS.GURU hashlookup mirror](https://apis.guru/apis/circl.lu/hashlookup). 

Just visit the link, scroll down to the latest version, then click download to save a local copy the OpenAPI spec file **in JSON format**:

You can also download the OpenAPI spec in YAML format, but we'll use JSON for this tutorial.

The beauty of OpenAPI is that tools like Postman and Redoc can import this file and give you a much friendlier interface than raw JSON or YAML. Think of the OpenAPI spec as the single source of truth: if the API changes, updating this file automatically updates your testing and documentation environments. We'll feed the OpenAPI spec file into Postman and Redoc in the next sections.
