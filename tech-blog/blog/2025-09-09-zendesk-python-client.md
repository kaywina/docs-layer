Sometimes as a technical writer, you'll need to connect to REST APIs. APIs allow you to programatically pull information from other knowledge centers. This can be especially useful for docs-as-code automation, where you what to read and/or write help center content via code.

If you’ve ever seen an API described as “OpenAPI/Swagger,” that means there’s a machine-readable file (YAML/JSON) that precisely defines the endpoints, parameters, and responses for the API.You should know - you can feed that file into a generator and get a typed Python client library—ready to import in a script.

This post shows the minimal path from zero to usable Python client, for the [Zendesk Help Center API](https://developer.zendesk.com/api-reference/help_center/help-center-api/introduction/). We’ll browse the spec, generate a client, install the client locally, and peek inside the API - all without requiring a Zendesk account.

## What you’ll build

To sum up the learning outcomes for this tutorial, you'll build:
- A local, pip-installable Python package generated from an OpenAPI file.
- Code you can import in your own scripts to explore operations and models.
- A repeatable workflow to demonstrate OpenAPI/Swagger + Python integration.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you'll need the following:
- [Python](https://www.python.org/) 3.8+ (3.11+ recommended)
- A terminal (macOS, Linux, or Windows)
- An OpenAPI file for any REST API you want to explore (YAML or JSON).

Please note - We’re intentionally *not* using Docker, Java, or Node here. Just Python, to keep things lightweight and simple.

For this tutorial, we're using the [OpenAI spec for the Zendesk Help Center API](https://developer.zendesk.com/api-reference/help_center/help-center-api/introduction/#download-openapi-file). Visit the link to download it.

Zendesk is a popular customer support platform used by businesses to manage requests, FAQs, and self-service resources. Its Help Center product powers searchable knowledge bases and community forums, while the Zendesk APIs let teams programmatically create, update, and organize content. For technical writers, developers, or support engineers, these APIs are a way to automate documentation workflows, sync data across tools, or extend Zendesk beyond its web interface.

Many other vendors provide a downloadable OpenAPI spec. You can apply the steps in this article to any of them.
