*What SaaS Docs, Game Engine Docs, and Game Studio Docs Teach Us About Technical Writing*

Every technical writer knows that documentation can mean wildly different things depending on where you work. Writing for a Software as a Service (SaaS) platform, a game engine, and a AAA game studio all fall under the same discipline. The expectations, processes, and audiences however, and even the cultural norms of the work, can feel like entirely different ecosystems.

I’ve worked primarily in SaaS, but have a fair amount of indie games development experience (check out my [digital archives](https://anachronic.itch.io/)) using [Unity](https://unity.com/). Looking back at my game dev history got me curious about how documentation practices shift across industries like game engines (Unity, Unreal) and game production studios (EA, Ubisoft, Bungie).

This article is the result: part research, part synthesis, and part reflection. The intention is to create a map of three documentation worlds that share a common purpose but diverge significantly in audience, purpose, and form.

If you're exploring a career move, trying to understand the shape of technical writing outside of your current domain, or are just curious about documentation practices across different industries, read on to learn how these three compare.

# SaaS Documentation: Fast, User-Facing, and Success-Oriented

In SaaS, user-facing docs are inseparable from the product experience. Users look to the help center not only to solve problems but to understand workflows, configure settings, and get quick explanations of what the software can do.

## What defines SaaS documentation:

- **Task-based structure:** Short, actionable, get-in-and-get-out writing.

- **Workflow clarity:** Users often aren’t technical; docs must keep cognitive load low.

- **Rapid updates:** SaaS ships constantly and docs must keep up.

- **Metrics-driven:** Knowledge-Centered Service (KCS) practices, self-service success, ticket deflection, onboarding speed.

- **Multiple personas:** Admins, curators, end users, support agents, customer success.

In SaaS, documentation is fundamentally about **reducing friction.**  Every page is an opportunity to prevent a ticket, shorten a setup process, or help a customer feel empowered instead of stuck.

The **writer’s role** blends information architecture (IA), user experience (UX) copy, support alignment, and relationship-building across product, engineering, and customer teams.
