*What SaaS Docs, Game Engine Docs, and Game Studio Docs Teach Us About Technical Writing*

Every technical writer knows that documentation can mean wildly different things depending on where you work. Writing for a SaaS platform, a game engine, and a AAA game studio all fall under the same discipline. The expectations, processes, and audiences however, and even the cultural norms of the work, can feel like entirely different ecosystems.

I’ve worked primarily in SaaS, but have a significant amount of indie games development experience (check out my [digital archives](https://anachronic.itch.io/)) using [Unity](https://unity.com/). Looking back at my game dev history got me curious about how documentation practices shift across industries like game engines (Unity, Unreal) and game production studios (EA, Ubisoft, Bungie).

This article is the result: part research, part synthesis, and part reflection. The intention is to create a map of three documentation worlds that share a common purpose but diverge significantly in audience, purpose, and form.

If you're exploring a career move, trying to understand the shape of technical writing outside of your current domain, or are just curious about documentation practices across different industries, read on to learn how these three compare.
