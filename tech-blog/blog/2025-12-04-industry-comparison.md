*What SaaS Docs, Game Engine Docs, and Game Studio Docs Teach Us About Technical Writing*

Every technical writer knows that documentation can mean wildly different things depending on where you work. Writing for a Software as a Service (SaaS) platform, a game engine, and a AAA game studio all fall under the same discipline. The expectations, processes, and audiences however, and even the cultural norms of the work, can feel like entirely different ecosystems.

I’ve worked primarily in SaaS, but have a fair amount of indie games development experience (check out my [digital archives](https://anachronic.itch.io/)) using [Unity](https://unity.com/). Looking back at my game dev history got me curious about how documentation practices shift across industries like game engines (Unity, Unreal) and game production studios (EA, Ubisoft, Bungie).

This article is the result: part research, part synthesis, and part reflection. The intention is to create a map of three documentation worlds that share a common purpose but diverge significantly in audience, purpose, and form.

If you're exploring a career move, trying to understand the shape of technical writing outside of your current domain, or are just curious about documentation practices across different industries, read on to learn how these three compare.

# SaaS Documentation: Fast, User-Facing, and Success-Oriented

In SaaS, user-facing docs are inseparable from the product experience. Users look to the help center not only to solve problems but to understand workflows, configure settings, and get quick explanations of what the software can do.

## What defines SaaS documentation:

- **Task-based structure:** Short, actionable, get-in-and-get-out writing.

- **Workflow clarity:** Users often aren’t technical; docs must keep cognitive load low.

- **Rapid updates:** SaaS ships constantly and docs must keep up.

- **Metrics-driven:** Knowledge-Centered Service (KCS) practices, self-service success, ticket deflection, onboarding speed.

- **Multiple personas:** Admins, end users, support agents, customer success, etc.

In SaaS, documentation is fundamentally about **reducing friction.**  Every page is an opportunity to prevent a ticket, shorten a setup process, or help a customer feel empowered instead of stuck.

The **writer’s role** blends information architecture (IA), user experience (UX) copy, support alignment, and relationship-building across product, engineering, and customer teams.

# Game Engine Documentation: Deep Technical Knowledge Meets Learning Design

Documentation for game engines like Unity or Unreal is an entirely different challenge. Instead of just describing user interface (UI) workflows, writers are often explaining core engine systems, scripting APIs, rendering pipelines, physics behaviour, cross-platform quirks, asset workflows, and dozens of interlocking tools.

A game engine is essentially **a platform for building worlds**, and the docs have to match that level of complexity.

## What defines game engine documentation:

- **Highly technical conceptual writing:** Explanations of how systems work, not just how to use them.

- **API references:** Thousands of entries, each requiring accuracy and clarity.

- **Code samples everywhere:** Real examples that devs can copy, paste, and modify.

- **Educational layer:** Tutorials, samples, guided projects, learning pathways.

- **Versioning pain:** Documentation breaks with every engine update.

Game engine writers operate somewhere between:
- technical educators,
- platform engineers,
- developer relations,
- and curriculum designers.

Where SaaS writers help users operate a product, game engine writers help creators **build entire experiences**. While there can definitely be overlap, at its root game engine documentation requires a different mental model, and a different writing craft.

# Game Studio Documentation: Pipelines, Processes, and the Hidden Machinery of Production

If game engine documentation is mostly outward-facing, game studio documentation is the opposite: it’s the **invisible infrastructure** that keeps a production pipeline from collapsing.

AAA game development involves hundreds of people across art, engineering, design, animation, writing, audio, QA, localization, and more. Each discipline often uses internal tools, custom pipelines, proprietary editors, and studio-specific engines.

Much of this tooling has rough edges or minimal UX, and so internal documentation therefore becomes indispensable.

## What defines game studio documentation:

- **Primarily internal audiences:** Designers, artists, level builders, QA testers, technical directors. User-facing documentation (manuals, quick references, maps, etc.) require heavy graphic design and bridge the gap between technical writing and marketing.

- **Process-heavy content:** Build pipelines, asset workflows, naming conventions, version control practices, approval paths.

- **Tooling documentation:** Internal editors, exporters, shaders, debugging tools, automation scripts.

- **High change velocity**: Production pipelines evolve mid-project.

- **Assumed or informal knowledge risk risk:** Studios often lack dedicated writers; knowledge lives in wikis or people’s heads.

Technical writing for game studios is less about customers and shipping a polished product — it’s about keeping the **team** functioning.

Bad documentation at a studio means high internal costs: missed deadlines, duplicated work, broken builds, integration failures, and staff (artists, designers, engineers, etc.) being blocked.

Here, a writer becomes a **systems stabilizer**, turning tacit knowledge into shared practice.
