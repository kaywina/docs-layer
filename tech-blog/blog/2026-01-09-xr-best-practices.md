Extended Reality (XR) products challenge many assumptions that traditional software documentation relies on. When users are wearing a headset, moving through physical space, and interacting with interfaces in three dimensions, static help articles and long-form explanations quickly break down.

In a recent report from The Docs Layer, [**Best Practices for Technical Writers Documenting XR Products**](/pdf/docs-layer-xr-best-practices.pdf), we explored how documentation must adapt to the realities of VR, AR, and mixed reality. This article highlights a few of the most important takeaways for technical writers working in immersive environments.

## 1. Documentation Must Live Inside the Experience

One of the most fundamental shifts in XR documentation is location. Users cannot easily consult external help while wearing a headset, and even short context switches can disrupt comfort and immersion.

Effective XR documentation prioritizes in-experience guidance, such as spatial tooltips, guided walkthroughs, and contextual help panels. Instead of explaining how an interaction works, documentation should demonstrate it, using visual cues, animation, and feedback that respond directly to user actions.

This approach turns documentation from a reference artifact into part of the user interface (UI) itself.

## 2. Input-Agnostic Language Matters

XR platforms support a wide range of input methods, including controllers, hand tracking, eye tracking, and voice commands. Documentation that hardcodes instructions to a specific button or gesture often fails the moment it reaches a new device, since input methods can vary between devices.

Best practice is to write **input-agnostic instructions** wherever possible, for example “activate the select input” rather than naming a specific trigger. Where platform differences matter, they should be clearly segmented and explicitly called out.

This reduces confusion, improves accessibility, and makes documentation more resilient as hardware evolves.

## 3. Safety and Comfort Are Documentation Concerns

In XR, poor documentation is not just inconvenient, it can be unsafe. Users need clear guidance on physical space requirements, locomotion options, comfort settings, and warning signs of discomfort.

Effective documentation treats safety guidance as first-class content, not a footnote. Comfort recommendations, boundary explanations, and accessibility options should be easy to find and framed as normal customization, not exceptional behavior.

This is especially important for first-time users, who may not yet understand how XR systems affect the body.

## 4. Spatial Interfaces Require Spatial Explanations

XR interfaces exist in depth, scale, and motion. Documentation needs to reflect that reality by explaining concepts like distance, anchoring, persistence, and field of view in spatial terms.

Where possible, these explanations should be visual and interactive, reinforcing understanding through placement and movement rather than text alone.

## Why This Matters for Technical Writers

As XR adoption grows in gaming, enterprise training, healthcare, and education, technical writers play a critical role in whether these products succeed or fail. Documentation that is demonstrative, accessible, and safety-aware directly affects onboarding speed, user confidence, and long-term adoption.
