title: Simplified Technical English (ASD-STE100): Why Clarity Still Matters

If you’ve ever opened a maintenance manual and found yourself re-reading the same sentence three times, you already understand the need for a standard like this. Somewhere between good intentions and bad phrasing, clarity disappears.

That’s what Simplified Technical English, known as **ASD-STE100**, was created to fix. It started in aerospace and spread outward, helping anyone who writes instructions that people actually have to follow.

## A Quick Look Back

Aircraft companies in the late 1970s were producing mountains of English-language documentation. The problem was that mechanics and translators couldn’t always agree on what it meant. Mistakes happened, costs went up, and confidence went down.

To get control of the language, European and North American organizations worked together on what became the AECMA Simplified English Guide in 1986. It later evolved into ASD-STE100, maintained by the **Aerospace, Security and Defence Industries Association of Europe (ASD)**.

Each new release of the STE updates the rules and keeps the system aligned with how people actually write today.

## How the Standard Works

ASD-STE100 has two main parts.

**Part 1** lays out fifty-three writing rules that cover grammar, sentence structure, and tone.

**Part 2** is a dictionary of roughly 850 approved words, each with a single meaning and part of speech. Companies can still add their own technical terms if they keep them consistent and unambiguous. Technical writers can submit words they think should be include in the standard dictionary.

Put together, these parts encourage a steady, readable rhythm in documentation, especially for global teams that depend on translation.

## Using the STE in Practice

Writing in STE might take some adjustment and un-learning. You start noticing how often you use filler words like “commence,” “utilize,” and “ensure.” The standard pushes you toward the simplest options, like “start,” “use,” and “make sure.” It also favors short, active sentences and one idea per line.

For example:

“Prior to initiation of maintenance operations, verification of the absence of electrical power must be ensured.”

turns into:

“Before you start maintenance, make sure the power is off.”

The latter sentence has the same meaning but much less reader friction. It’s so much easier to read, therefore reducing the risk of misunderstanding.

## Why It Still Works

These rules help in any field where clarity and safety matter. Engineers, technicians, and translators all benefit from consistency. Clear language also improves machine translation, which makes global publishing faster and cheaper.

STE may have been born in aerospace, but it has grown into a practical approach for anyone managing complex documentation.

## What It Doesn’t Cover

STE focuses on language, not layout. It says nothing about fonts, punctuation style, or units of measure. You still need your own style guide for that.

Neither is it a tool for learning English. Writers need a good command of the language before they can apply the STE rules effectively.

## Why It’s Still Relevant

Today most documentation lives inside automated pipelines and version-controlled repositories. Even in that environment, and when using AI to produce content, the principles of STE remain solid. Technical writers should know what STE is, even if they work outside the aerospace, security, and defence industries where it is widely applied.

We’re reminded that technology can help us, but it can’t replace clarity. Every line of text still depends on a writer choosing the right words for a reader who needs to understand them quickly. That’s the point of Simplified Technical English: not limitation, but respect for the reader’s time, attention, and trust.
