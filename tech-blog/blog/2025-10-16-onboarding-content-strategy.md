title: Designing for Flow: Applying UX Theory to Onboarding Documentation

When I first started working on user onboarding content, I inherited what many technical writers eventually encounter: a **help center maze**.

Every topic linked to everything else. Setup articles linked to configuration guides that linked to troubleshooting docs that linked back to setup again. The intention was good — make sure users have every option at their fingertips — but in practice, it produced chaos.

New users didn’t know where to start or what to do next. They clicked, skimmed, clicked again, and left. The were overwhelmed almost immediately.

So I redesigned the onboarding journey — not just by rewriting, but by **restructuring.** Instead of scattering information across dozens of disconnected articles, I created a *guided path*: docs for each specific type of user structured in a sequential order. Each doc focused on a single stage of setup; each one leading naturally to the next.

It worked. Users began moving through the flow without confusion. Support requests dropped, as did negative reactions to the onboarding docs. And I realized something important:
    
    **Good onboarding content isn’t just clear — it’s choreographed.**

That insight is where documentation overlaps with **content strategy** and **UX theory**.

Below, I’ll share how three classic design principles — the F-shaped reading pattern, the Law of Proximity, and Miller’s Law — shaped this approach.
