Hi, I’m Kaywin and welcome to my technical writing blog.

I am a technical writer in the SaaS world — building customer-facing knowledge base content, API documentation, and dev tooling content for fast-moving products.

At Klue, I managed a knowledge base serving 25,000+ active users, maintained release notes and hundreds of articles, and collaborated across product, engineering, design, quality assurance, and marketing teams to keep docs accurate and reliable.

I've also created training docs for VR apps, written SR&ED applications and grant proposals for commercial startups and non-profits, collaborated on UI copy, and produced countless SEO-optimized words for the web.

## What is this blog about?
The Docs Layer is where I share what I’ve learned (and what I’m still learning) about:  

- **Docs-as-code**: version control, static site generators, workflows that scale  
- **AI + writing**: where automation helps in tech writing — and where it doesn’t  
- **Human-centered communication**: techniques for clarity, collaboration, and trust  
- **The craft of technical writing**: everything from release notes to API docs to the overlooked details like polished screenshots and optimized metadata

I’ll also talk about the messy parts: experiments that didn’t land, challenges in scaling docs, and how writing work intersects with design systems, developer culture, and product velocity.

## Why “The Docs Layer” name?
Because good docs aren’t an afterthought. They’re part of the stack — a layer as crucial as infrastructure, APIs, or UI. Without them, the system doesn’t hold together.  

This blog is my way of exploring that idea and inviting others to sharpen their edge in docs-as-code, writing, and communication. It's also a fun pun.
