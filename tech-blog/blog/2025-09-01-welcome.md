Hello, my name is Kaywin. Welcome to my technical writing blog.

I am a technical writer with experience in enterprise-level Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) and emerging technologies. I build scalable customer-facing knowledge base content, API documentation, and dev tooling content in high-stakes environments.

At Klue I owned and managed a knowledge base for 25,000+ active users, maintained release notes, and authored hundreds of customer-facing articles. I've also created training docs for VR apps, written SR&ED applications and grant proposals for commercial startups and non-profits, collaborated on UI copy, and produced countless words with SEO for the web.

## What is this blog about?
The Docs Layer is where I intend to share what I’ve learned (and what I’m still learning) about technical writing:  

- **Docs-as-code**: version control, static site generators, and workflows that scale  
- **AI-augmented writing**: where automation helps in tech writing, and where it doesn’t  
- **Human-centered communication**: techniques that promote clarity, collaboration, and trust  

My hope is that, by sharing my learning, I can help other technical writers hone their craft and achieve success at scale.

## Why “The Docs Layer” name?
Good docs are part of the stack. They’re a layer as crucial as infrastructure, APIs, or UI. Without them, the system falls apart and users are left floundering.

This blog is my way of exploring the idea of documentation as an integral layer in the modern tech stack. Even more importantly, the name is a fun pun.
