Hi, I’m Kaywin and welcome to my blog.

For the past several years, I’ve been a technical writer in the SaaS world — building customer-facing knowledge bases, API documentation, and dev tooling content for fast-moving products. At Klue Labs, I scaled a knowledge base serving 25,000+ active users, maintained hundreds of articles, and collaborated across product, engineering, design, and support teams to keep docs as reliable as the code itself.  

Throughout my career I have:  
- Experimented with **docs-as-code workflows**, creating and managing pipelines using both Hugo and Docusaurus static site generators + GitHub to publish structured content.  
- Helped design system guilds and CSS theming projects to bring **consistency and brand alignment** into customer docs.  
- Used **AI tooling** not as a replacement, but as a drafting and research partner to sharpen clarity and speed.  
- Written about APIs, release notes, design systems, VR apps, and even grant proposals — always with the same goal: connect people with technology through clear, human-centered documentation.

## What this blog is about
The Docs Layer is where I share what I’ve learned (and what I’m still learning) about:  

- **Docs-as-code**: version control, static site generators, workflows that scale  
- **AI + writing**: where automation helps in tech writing — and where it doesn’t  
- **Human-centered communication**: techniques for clarity, collaboration, and trust  
- **The craft of technical writing**: everything from release notes to API docs to the overlooked details like polished screenshots and optimized metadata

I’ll also talk about the messy parts: experiments that didn’t land, challenges in scaling docs, and how writing work intersects with design systems, developer culture, and product velocity.

## Why “The Docs Layer”?
Because good docs aren’t an afterthought. They’re part of the stack — a layer as crucial as infrastructure, APIs, or UI. Without them, the system doesn’t hold together.  

This blog is my way of exploring that idea and inviting others to sharpen their edge in docs-as-code, writing, and communication.
